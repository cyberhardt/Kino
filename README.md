Description: A program that darkens the whole screen, except for a user-defined area, with which you can interact (means you can play games on it, for example). You can also hide the taskbar, change the dimness (including making it 100% black), and hide the Kino UI as per the second screenshot. It also works with several screens. This is a mirror of the original sourceforge repository at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pskino/, made by https://github.com/phischdev/.

This program works on Windows 10, and most likely on 7/8/11 as well but I can't be 100% sure.

The program is very lightweight, using around 13 MB of RAM.
